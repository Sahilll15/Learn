In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables that can be used within a class.

Class Variables:

A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class.
It is defined at the class level, outside of any methods.
It can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class.
Class variables are useful for storing data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or configuration data.
Instance Variables:

An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.
It is defined within a method, typically the init method, and is prefixed with the self keyword.
It can only be accessed using an instance of the class.
Instance variables are useful for storing data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as attributes of the object.
In summary, the main differences between class variables and instance variables in Python are their scope and the way they are accessed. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class and can only be accessed using an instance of the class.
